# AdGuard-IP-Linker
Automates the process of connecting your IP to AdGuard's Plain DNS server addresses

Just a simple batch file you can attach at start up to connect your IP to AdGuard's DNS server addresses.
If the file does not work with your browser, just replace the "msedge.exe" in "@taskkill /f /im msedge.exe >nul" with whatever browser you have, the edge.exe just names the process.
